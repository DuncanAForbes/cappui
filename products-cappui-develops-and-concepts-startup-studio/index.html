                 <h2>Our focus is to build two to three great products each year. Through proving the hypothesis of ideas that solve real problems. And bring together elite creative and entrepreneurial talent. Where we create teams to craft, test and grow these into products that can be turned into innovative and disruptive companies. That could become profitable global businesses.</h2>

                <h3 class="h3-white" >Our Market Focus.</h3>
                <p  class="p-white">Below  are the markets where we are brainstorming and researching ideas. Which we will prove a hypothesis for. And if the hypothesis can not be proven. We will continue iterating until we find a large unsolved problem. And then turn it into a commercial product through incubation phase fast. Working closely with our target customers as early on as possible. Then turn the product into a company when we enter growth phase. Once we have determined how we can effectively and elegantly address a key market. To continue growing the product into a global company.</p>

                  <h2>Crafting The Futures Information
                      Supply Chain Network Infrastructure.
                      And Organising its Digital DNA.</h2>

                  <p>The Famoi network aims to make the leap of transitioning from hybrid digital and traditional information Supply Chain solutions simple for both small businesses and enterprises. This new decentralised network being crafted on top of Ethereum will allow information to be exchanged between vendors and suppliers without the worry of information leakage. More importantly Famoi will help promote industry wide collaboration and end-user transparency between suppliers and vendors. Providing a platform that is both developer and end-user friendly for custom solutions using Famoi. And end-user product discovery tools for consumers to learn more about the products they buy and their provenance before purchasing goods.</p>
