                    <h3>Architecting solutions that are modulistic and use the latest in distributed or decentralised technologies</h3>
                
                   <p>Modern development of solutions requires a programmatic approach. This approach is fundamental to building durable solutions connected through micro-services spread across a distributed network for persistence and limited downtime. With continuous delivery to market and infinite testing cycles being paramount. The below explains our thought process and approach to handling the development of solutions for our products or clients.</p>

                <p>Collaboration is key to Cappui’s growth. As technology evolves we must adapt to these changes fast. Being able to easily adopt them into our solutions. Our design process is concerned with simplicity and agile philosophies. Where the end-user comes first. And software must be an interactive and engaging experience.</p>

                <p>The core foundations of our solutions may be architected as distributed systems that communicate through micro-services between one another. For high-availability and scaleability in mind. Or decentralised systems. For our commitment to researching and experimenting with emerging technologies. </p>
