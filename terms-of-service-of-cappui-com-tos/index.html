                    And are a legal agreement between you and Cappui.</h2>

                     <p>Welcome to Cappui! (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We are excited to have you as a vistor. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.cappui.com, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Cappui.com (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here: https://www.cappui.com/privacy-policy-of-cappui-com</p>

                     <p>We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Cappui, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service</p>

                     <p>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at support@cappui.com. Cappui is all about building innovative and globally market competing products in technology, and we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.</p>

                    <p>Docracy is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since "major" is a very subjective concept, you can always monitor and subscribe to changes via our TOS Tracker (yes, we track our own Terms!). Of course, this document is public on Docracy, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version (just click on the "See all versions" button on the right). Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>
